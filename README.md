## Problem Statement ##
Due to the recent economic and supply-chain turmoil gasoline prices across the world have been on the rise. This has impacted the price of every commodity, and contributed to inflation which in turn feeds back to further impact gas prices. Thus, the ability to predict future gasoline prices would be crucial to prepare and device measures to ameliorate the situation. We have identified that gasoline prices are primarily driven by classical economic theory of supply and demand. The supply of gasoline to the US is primarily from domestic crude oil wells and imports from other nations. The US also maintains a strategic petroleum reserve to handle the disruptions in the crude oil supply chain. Demand of gasoline is primarily reflected by domestic consumption. Other than these, inflation limits the purchasing power thus affecting both production/import and consumtion of gasoline. It is usually measured as Consumer Price Index (CPI) by the Federal Bank of the US. Further, changes in taxation at federal and state level will also impact the prices, however it remains constant over a long duration. Finally, we will also use historical trends in gasoline prices to capture any missing features. 

### To summarize, we are building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the weekly gasoline price based on the following features: ###

    - Weekly crude oil import (Supply)
    - Strategic Petroleum Reserve (Supply)
    - Domestic Production (Supply)
    - Domestic Consumption of Gas (Demand)
    - Domestic Inflation as CPI
    - Historical Price of Gasoline
